# twenty-tester
  ###Current Version 1.6d0 Likable Lich

  Developed to numerically simulate interesting features of combat in d20 games.

##Files included in distribution:

  TTDriver.py - sets up the parameters that will be run and handles I/O

  TT.py - simulates the encounter

  Friend.csv - user input csv file that defines one side of the encounter

  FoeX.csv - user input csv file that defines the other side of the encounter.  
  
  setup.cfg - user input csv file that defines the parameters of the analysis runs

  TTlogo.png - the beautiful logo for twenty-tester
  
  Files are provided setup to perform an analysis of foe encounter size across Foe1 through Foe5 files.

###Please see the GitHub wiki for information on the csv files.

##RELEASE NOTES:

1.  TT.py is now driven by TTDriver.py, parameter changes for multiple runs can be set using runsetup.cfg

2.  Files in release are set up to show a sweep through an encounter of various sizes to determine what is a challenge for the party

3.  Code is sloppy, inefficient and poorly commented, but it seems to work
